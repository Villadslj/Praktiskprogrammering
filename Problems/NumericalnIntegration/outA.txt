Part A.
Calculating the integral of Sqrt(x) dx from a=0 to b=1
Tish gives 0.66667
Where the analytical result is 0.66667.
Next we calculate the integral of 4* Sqrt(1-x^2) dx from a=0 to b=1
The result is 3.14159
Where again the analytical result is 3.14159. So both numerical integrals seem to match the analytical result
