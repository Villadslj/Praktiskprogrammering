Part B
We want to calculate the integral 1/Sqrt(x) dx from a=0 to b=1 and ln(x)/Sqrt(x) with the same baundaries using the Clenshaw-Curtis transformaiton, to check if the transformation have improvements for integrals with integrable divergencies.
The result is 1.99999, with 16 number of calls to the function. The analytical result is 2.000.
Calculating the integral without Clenshaw-Curtis transformation gives {res2:f5}, with {noOfCalls} number of calls to the function

We now calculate the integral of ln(x)/Sqrt(x) dx from a=0 to b=1 with Clenshaw-Curtis transformaiton. 
This gives -3.99987, with 96 number of calls to the function. The analytical result is -4.00
Without the transformation we get -3.99992, with 8604 number of calls to the function
The Clenshaw-Curtis transformaiton do infact reduce the number of calls quiet significantly

At last we calculate the integral 4 * Sqrt(1-x^2) dx from a=0 to b=1 with Clenshaw-Curtis transformaiton
The result is 3.1415763865, with 44 number of calls to the function, where the analtical resutl is pi
Again the result without the transformation is 3.1418345780, with 28 number calls to the function
Comparing to the 'o8av' integrator routine from matlib, the result is 3.1413229434, with 8 number of calls to the function
We see that  'o8av' uses fewer calls but is also less accurate.
